# Live preview

To preview the project live, open the html page you want to preview in the VSCode editor and click the "show preview" icon in the right top corner. It will start the local webserver within VSCode and open another tab with the preview, which you can close as it's not very convenient, and instead direct your external browser to `http://127.0.0.1:3000/`.  

Note that you should not use "localhost" instead of 127.0.0.1 as this results in some 401 server authentication errors when loading some of the assets.
