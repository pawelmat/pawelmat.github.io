              <h4 class="mb-4">In the 24th century, Earth lies within an intricate web of conquest, politics, and economic gain.</h4>
              <p>At the outermost points of this web lie the bridgeheads — locations of strategic importance for Earth’s galactic defence and interplanetary communication systems.</p>
              <p>One of these bridgeheads was situated on a small, distant planet orbiting Tau Ceti, about 12 light years from Earth and marked on stellar maps as B104-GS12. Once a “verge world” of Earth’s galactic empire, it first became known for the discovery of stone structures created by a long‑gone, primitive alien civilization. A military training and research base had been built atop one of these vast, ancient underground complexes. However, as the galactic frontier expanded rapidly, the base lost its strategic significance and remained active only as a research facility into the alien culture and as a refuelling point for interstellar cargo travelling across the galaxy.</p>
              <p>This did not last long, as the facility sat too far from the main transport routes. Additional structures were added to the base, and the site was eventually transformed into a harsh penal colony. Two years later, the colony was officially closed, as B104-GS12 was said to be in the path of a massive meteor swarm. This, however, was a fabrication from the Military Council, who had their own plans for B104-GS12.</p>
              <p>Consequently, the base became shrouded in mystery after being taken over by BioTec, a private company backed by Earth’s Central Government and the Military Council. Rumours began circulating among space cargo pilots about transports carrying sophisticated laboratory equipment and materials—presumably used to modify and expand the base, which BioTec internally referred to as the Citadel.</p>
              <p>Away from prying eyes, death‑row inmates from other penal colonies were secretly transferred to the Citadel and used as additional slave labour to complete the base’s modifications. A few months later, a vast, secret laboratory became operational. While officially labelled a BioTec verge world research facility, in practice it was an undercover, military‑funded lab conducting ethically dubious—and officially forbidden—research into extreme biotechnological enhancements to the human body. Most of the former inmates became test subjects.</p>
              <p>At the start of 2305, all communication between the Citadel and BioTec HQ on Earth ceased without warning. Efforts to restore the link failed, prompting BioTec and the Military Council to convene and ultimately decide to send a special landing force to B104-GS12 to determine what had occurred.</p>
              <p>A modern military spaceship, X16, with a crew of over 950, was dispatched to B104-GS12. Officially, it was on a reconnaissance and training flight, but the true purpose of the mission had been kept secret, and the crew were only briefed as they approached the destination. The orders from Earth were short and direct: "Communications and control over the Citadel must be restored at all costs. If this is not possible, then the Citadel must be destroyed."</p>
              <p>As the X16 approached the planet, it repeatedly failed to make contact with the Citadel, which remained silent on all wavelengths. With final preparations for landing underway, a decision was made to send a small reconnaissance unit—“Scout 01”—to investigate the base at closer range. Just before its launch, the main ship’s defence and communications systems went down for unknown reasons, initiating a lengthy diagnostic and reboot procedure.</p>
              <p>You were one of the two pilots aboard the Scout. Wary of the Citadel’s defence mechanisms, you and your co‑pilot orbited the planet several times, taking pictures and readings. As your Scout completed a sweep of the planet, something went catastrophically wrong. A rocket launched from the Citadel and headed directly for your mothership, obliterating the unsuspecting and defenceless X16, damaging the Scout, and sending a horrifying shudder down your spine as you were forced to make an emergency crash landing on the planet’s surface.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, your co‑pilot did not survive the crash. YOU are the sole survivor—11 light years from home, with no one aware of your fate and no rescue coming anytime soon. Amid the falling debris of the X16, you make your way toward an emergency side entrance to the Citadel, leading you into the underground, post‑alien section of the facility.</p>
              <p>You know that your only chance of survival—and of ever returning home—may lie somewhere within the Citadel.</p>
              <p>Driven by the will to live, you are prepared to do anything necessary to ensure your survival.</p>
              <p class="lead" style="color:#ff6b6b;font-weight:700;">It’s you against the Citadel—and whatever evil lurks within.</p>
