# Introduction
This file contains instructions for Github Copilot. It is not actively used by Copilot and serves more as a record of what has been requested of it.

# Project description
The project is a website, designed based on a ready-made Bootstrap template, with many css styles, js helpers, and possible layout elements defined by both the Bootstrap framework and the template itself.

# Project organisation
- All main html files of the project are in the main folder
- ./assets contains subfolders with css, js files, all graphics, and 3rd party vendor extensions used in the project
- ./game folder shall not be analysed or changed, this is a WebGL game that can be run from the website. it WILL NOT be changed in this project and DOES NOT NEED ANALYZING.


# Bootstrap documentation
This is the link to Bootstrap online documentation: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/
The most important sections are Layout, Components, Content and Customize.

# Bootstrap examples
Analyse the existing .html files in the main folder, as well as css and js files used by them, to see several examples of using different bootstrap components within the additional stylisation of the web template used.
External bootstrap examples can be found here: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/examples/.

# What will be changed
The project will focus on changing the .html files in the main folder into the intended website.
You should help with adding the required content using defined Bootstrap components, and also adapting styles as requested. The priority should be to use existing Bootstrap and existing template styles before creating new ones.
